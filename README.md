# Gameshow-Door-Problem
Fun code implementation from the movie 21 black jack. Gameshow problem.

The game show problem
There are 3 doors. One of which has a goat. You try to pick which door has the goat

You pick a door randomly,
The gamemaster knows where the goat is, he opens one door and shows there is no goat.

Do you switch or stay with your initial choice?

Code shows you twice as more likely to get the right choice by switching than staying, running it for over 1000 tries. Repeated tests show ~200 percent increase
